# Sunspot-Time-Series-Prediction-using-ELM and ANFIS-

The time series prediction problem is the prediction of future values based on previous values and the current values of the time series.

The task here is to predict the sunspot number S(t) at a year t , given as much as 12 previous sunpot numbers, 4 time lags , S(t-1) , S(t-2) , S(t-6) , S(t-12) in order to predict S(t)

Dataset used solar_dataset (Matlab)
